# Buffer Audit File Writes in Reconcile

## Problem Statement

Each reconciled item triggers `appendFile()` which opens, seeks, writes, and closes the audit file. For 1,000 items this is 1,000 open/write/close cycles.

## Findings

- **Source:** Performance Oracle (OPT-1)
- **File:** `src/cli/commands/reconcile.ts` (lines 416-422)

## Proposed Solutions

- Open a file handle once, write during loop, close in `finally`
- Or buffer lines in memory and flush periodically
- Expected gain: 50-80% reduction in audit I/O

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit file opened once per batch, not per item
- [ ] All audit entries still written correctly
