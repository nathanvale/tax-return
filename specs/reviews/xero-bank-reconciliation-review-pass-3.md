1. **Verdict**: **REQUEST CHANGES**

2. **Strengths**
- PKCE + `state` + loopback callback is the right OAuth pattern for a local CLI.
- You explicitly treat refresh-token rotation/idempotency as a first-class concern.
- Using Keychain over plaintext files is the correct default for a financial tool.
- You already have a redaction policy, which is better than most v1 CLI plans.

3. **Critical issues (must fix before implementation)**
- **Keychain access control is too weak/ambiguous**. With `security add-generic-password -s xero-tax-return -a <key> -w ... -U`, any same-user process can likely call `/usr/bin/security` and read/overwrite these items if ACLs permit. This is a real local-token theft/tampering risk for financial credentials.
- **Service/account namespace collision is real**. A shared service name (`xero-tax-return`) + generic accounts (`access_token`, `refresh_token`) enables cross-tool overwrite/poisoning. `-U` makes this worse by silently updating existing records.
- **Token persistence is non-atomic and can create torn auth state**. Storing `refresh_token`, `access_token`, `expires_at` as separate items means crash/interruption can leave inconsistent tuples. For single-use refresh tokens, this can strand the session or trigger bad recovery logic.
- **Payment execution safety is insufficient**. Real payment creation should not be a casual default. `--dry-run` opt-in is dangerous; accidental live execution is a direct money-movement risk.
- **Error context leakage risk is unresolved**. `StructuredError.context` and default error serialization can leak OAuth code/verifier/token/request bodies unless you enforce strict allowlist-based logging and sanitization on all thrown errors.

4. **Important observations (should fix)**
- **PKCE verifier length**: `Uint8Array(32)` is spec-compliant (43 chars base64url, minimum allowed). It is not a vulnerability. Using 48 or 64 bytes is a robustness margin, not a security requirement.
- **Fixed `127.0.0.1:3000` callback port**: main risk is local DoS/hijack-by-bind. Code theft is harder without verifier, but attacker can still break flow and potentially capture artifacts if other leaks exist. Prefer random ephemeral loopback port if Xero allows it; if not, bind before launching browser and hard-fail clearly if port occupied.
- **Refresh crash scenario you asked about is recoverable only if startup always forces refresh when access token missing/expired** and never assumes access token must exist. Document and test this explicitly.
- **Browser profile risk**: `~/.xero-session` is a durable high-value artifact. Treat as secret material; enforce `0700` dir perms, avoid broad backup/sync, and consider ephemeral profiles for reconciliation runs.
- **Fallback file storage**: `chmod 600` on file is not enough; parent dir must be `0700`, writes should be atomic + fsync, and file should never coexist with Keychain in normal mode.

5. **Nice-to-haves**
- Store one encrypted/serialized token bundle (single record) with version + checksum instead of multiple independent keychain entries.
- Add a “live mode” interlock: require `--execute` plus typed confirmation (`type org name + payment count + total`).
- Add runtime “scope audit” command that prints granted scopes and blocks if unexpected extra scopes appear.
- Add security event logs (non-sensitive): token refresh success/failure, keychain write failures, live payment confirmation accepted/rejected.

6. **Questions for the author**
- What exact Keychain ACL/trust settings will you set on created items, and how will you verify they are not world-readable to same-user processes?
- Why is `accounting.settings` required for this workflow? Can you remove it from v1 scopes?
- What is the exact sanitizer boundary for `StructuredError.context`, `cause`, and HTTP client errors?
- Will live payment mode require explicit typed confirmation in TypeScript code (not only via Claude command UX)?
- What is your recovery algorithm when token tuple is inconsistent (e.g., refresh exists, access missing, expiry missing)?
- Is `~/.xero-session` excluded from Time Machine/cloud sync, and are directory permissions enforced at startup?

7. **Synthesis**
Across all three passes, the plan is now well-scrutinized on architecture, scope, and now security, but it is still not implementation-ready. The remaining high risk is credential and payment safety under failure and local compromise conditions: Keychain ACL/namespace hardening, atomic token-state design, strict log sanitization, and explicit live-payment interlocks must be nailed down first. If those are addressed, residual risk becomes operational (local malware/same-user compromise and browser-session theft), which can be reduced with profile hardening and safer defaults but not eliminated in a local CLI model.
