# xero-cli Reference

CLI for reading and writing Xero bank transaction data. JSON in, JSON out.

Run all commands from the tax-return project root (where `package.json` lives).

## Commands

| Command | Alias | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `status` | -- | Preflight check (auth, config, API connectivity) |
| `auth` | -- | OAuth2 PKCE flow (browser-based, human interaction required) |
| `transactions` | `tx` | Read bank transactions |
| `accounts` | `acct` | Read chart of accounts |
| `invoices` | `inv` | Read invoices |
| `history` | `hist` | Read past reconciled transactions (grouped by contact) |
| `reconcile` | `rec` | Create reconciliation entries (stdin JSON or CSV) |

For complete flag reference and examples, read [references/command-reference.md](references/command-reference.md).

For error codes, retry policy, and batch strategy, read [references/error-handling.md](references/error-handling.md).

## Output Contract

**Success (stdout):**
```json
{"status":"data","schemaVersion":1,"data":{"command":"...","count":N,...},"warnings":["field 'Contcat.Name' was undefined in all records -- check spelling."],"phase":"result"}
```

- `warnings` (optional array) - present when `--fields` contains names that resolve to undefined in all records. Indicates likely typos. When an agent sees a warning, it should check field spelling against the valid PascalCase dot-path names (e.g., `Contact.Name` not `Contcat.Name`).
- `phase` (optional string) - present in headless auth NDJSON two-phase contract. Values: `"auth_url"` (first line), `"result"` (second line). See [headless auth](references/command-reference.md#auth) for details.

**Error (stderr):**
```json
{"status":"error","message":"...","error":{"name":"UsageError","code":"E_USAGE","action":"FIX_ARGS","retryable":false,"context":{"invalidFields":["Contcat.Name"],"validFieldsHint":"Fields are PascalCase dot paths (e.g., Contact.Name, BankTransactionID)..."}}}
```

- `context` (optional object) - structured metadata for programmatic error recovery. Contents vary by error type. Example: `invalidFields` array lists the rejected field names, and `validFieldsHint` string describes the expected naming convention. Agents should use `context` to self-correct before retrying.

Auto-JSON: when stdout is not a TTY, `--json` is enabled automatically.

## Observability and Debugging

### Three-Tier Output Architecture

| Tier | Destination | Content | When |
|------|------------|---------|------|
| stdout | Program output | JSON data envelopes | Always |
| stderr | Diagnostic logs | LogTape structured logs | `--verbose` / `--debug` / on error |
| events | Observability server | Fire-and-forget telemetry | `--events-url` set |

### Flag-to-Level Mapping

| Flag | Log Level | What You See on stderr |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| (none) | silent | Nothing on success; full debug trace on error (fingers-crossed) |
| `--quiet` | silent | Nothing (fingers-crossed disabled) |
| `--verbose` | info | CLI lifecycle, API call summaries, reconcile progress |
| `--debug` | debug | All of verbose + request/response details, parsed options, state checkpoints |

### Fingers-Crossed Pattern

When no verbosity flag is set (and not in `--json` or `--quiet` mode), the CLI buffers all log messages. If the command succeeds, the buffer is discarded (zero noise). If the command fails with an error, the entire buffered log (including debug-level messages) is flushed to stderr automatically. This gives you full diagnostic context on failures without any upfront `--debug` flag.

### Events (--events-url)

```bash
bun run xero-cli reconcile --execute --json --events-url http://localhost:3000/events
```

Or via environment variables:
- `XERO_EVENTS_URL` - observability server URL
- `XERO_EVENTS=0` - disable events even when URL is configured

Events are fire-and-forget HTTP POSTs. They never block or slow down CLI operations.

### Agent Debugging Workflow

1. **Normal run** - no flags needed. If it fails, you get a full debug trace automatically (fingers-crossed).
2. **Proactive debugging** - add `--verbose` to see lifecycle events during the run.
3. **Deep debugging** - add `--debug` to see every API call, parsed option, and state write.

### Log Format

- **Human mode (TTY stderr):** Console-formatted text via LogTape
- **Agent mode (non-TTY stderr or `--json`):** JSON Lines format on stderr (one JSON object per line)
- Override with `XERO_LOG_FORMAT=text` or `XERO_LOG_FORMAT=json`

## Safety Rules

These rules apply to ALL workflows that use xero-cli.

### BankTransactionID Immutability

BankTransactionID is an opaque key. Carry it unchanged from the `transactions` fetch through proposal, review, and execute.

- NEVER reconstruct IDs from display fields (Contact name, amount, date)
- If dropping a transaction from a proposal, drop the entire entry
- If an ID is not in the current unreconciled set, the CLI rejects it

### Cross-Command Auth Recovery

Read commands (`transactions`, `accounts`, `history`, `invoices`) produce output valid for the duration of Claude's context window. Re-auth does NOT invalidate previously fetched data.

If `reconcile` fails with `E_UNAUTHORIZED` mid-workflow:
1. Run `bun run xero-cli auth`
2. Re-run `reconcile` with the same stdin (idempotent resume via state file)
3. Do NOT re-fetch transactions -- data in context is still valid

### Invoice Amount/CurrencyCode Derivation

For invoice matches, derive:
- `Amount` from the BankTransaction's `Total` field
- `CurrencyCode` from the BankTransaction's `CurrencyCode` field

Both fields are required in the reconcile input. If the BankTransaction currency does not match the Invoice currency, flag for manual review.

### Contact Name Normalization

Bank descriptions are inconsistent (e.g., "GITHUB INC" vs "GITHUB.COM" vs "GH *GITHUB"). When matching against history:

- Strip common suffixes: PTY LTD, INC, LLC, CORP, LIMITED, P/L
- Normalize whitespace (collapse multiple spaces, trim)
- Case-insensitive comparison
- If match confidence is low, present to user for review rather than assuming

### Token Budget

Never load all transactions + full history + full accounts into a single prompt. Use progressive loading:

1. Load accounts once (~2K tokens via `--fields Code,Name,Type`)
2. Load history grouped (~4K tokens via `--fields Contact,AccountCode,Count,AmountMin,AmountMax`)
3. Load transactions in chunks of 50 (~5K tokens per chunk via `--fields`)
4. Analyze and propose per chunk
5. Accumulate proposals
6. Present summary to user

Target: <20K tokens per analysis step.
