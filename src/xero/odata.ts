/**
 * Escape a user-supplied string for safe interpolation into a Xero OData
 * `where` clause. Xero uses double-quoted string literals in its OData
 * dialect, so the primary risk is unescaped double quotes allowing an
 * attacker to break out of the string context and inject additional filter
 * operators.
 *
 * This function:
 * - Rejects values containing double quotes (`"`), which would allow
 *   breaking out of the OData string literal boundary.
 * - Rejects values containing logical operators (`&&`, `||`) that could
 *   append additional filter clauses.
 * - Rejects values containing comparison operators (`==`, `!=`) that
 *   could introduce new field comparisons.
 *
 * Rather than silently escaping (which could mask bugs or attacks), we
 * throw so the caller can surface a clear validation error to the user.
